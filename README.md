# TrashRecon

TrashRecon is a comprehensive Python-based reconnaissance framework designed for security researchers and penetration testers. It automates various phases of the information gathering process, enhancing the efficiency and depth of security assessments.

## Features

- Subdomain Enumeration: Utilizes tools like puredns, subfinder, amass, assetfinder, waybackurls, and waymore to discover subdomains.
- HTTP Status Check and Sorting: Uses httpx to check the availability and status of discovered domains.
- DNS Record Extraction: Extracts A and CNAME records using dnsx.
- Port Scanning: Conducts thorough port scans on identified IPs using smap.
- Screenshot Capture: Takes screenshots of live domains using aquatone.
- Vulnerability Pattern Search: Searches for common vulnerability patterns in URLs using gf.
- Subdomain Takeover Checking: Checks for vulnerable subdomains using subzy.
- Endpoint Crawling: Crawls endpoints to gather more data using katana.
- API Key Scanning: Optionally scans for exposed API keys using secretx, providing an option to skip this resource-intensive task.
