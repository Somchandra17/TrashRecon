# TrashRecon

TrashRecon is a Python-based reconnaissance tool designed to automate the process of subdomain enumeration, extracting A and CNAME records, running Smap on records, taking screenshots of endpoints, and more. It's built for security researchers and penetration testers to streamline the initial phases of information gathering.

## Features

- Subdomain enumeration using `puredns`, `subfinder`, `amass`, and `assetfinder`.
- HTTP status check and sorting using `httpx`.
- A and CNAME record extraction with `dnsx`.
- Port scanning with `smap`.
- Screenshot capture of live domains using `aquatone`.
- URL extraction using `waybackurls` and `waymore`.
- Vulnerability pattern matching using `gf`.
- Subdomain takeover detection using `subzy`.
